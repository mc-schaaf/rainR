Description: Bundles together some functions that I repeatedly use.  One
    focus is data handling (merging, etc.), and the other iswrappers and 
    shorthand calls for other
    functions.  It comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY and will be
    refactored continuously.  Backwards-compatibility will not be
    guaranteed.  Therefore, if using for scientific purposes, please be
    explicit about the version used.  Maybe even put the used source
    bundle to your analysis scripts.
